### Ordering
To place an order, write anything.

You will be asked if you want to make an order on location or online.

Depending on this, you will have to input some data.

You will see the menu from which you can choose your meals.

When you are done, complete the order.
### Admin
To log in into the admin settings, just write admin.

You will see a lot of different options.

Manage employees - hire, dismiss or see info about employees.

Control restaurant - open or close the restaurant.

Edit the menu - add, remove or set item's availability.

Order data - statistics and history of orders.

Logout - log out of admin's settings.

Close applications - end the process.
